Up before hitting their serve,\n            the\n            server’s feet must never move in front of the baseline on the court.If the server’s initial serve is\n            unsuccessful,\n            they may receive a second serve. If they fail to serve their second serve, a double fault will be called and\n            the\n            point will be forfeited.If the server hits the net but the ball still lands in the service area, a let is\n            called\n            and\n            they are free to accept the service again. If the ball hits the net and does not land in the service area,\n            the\n            player is called out and the service is forfeited.Upon receiving the service, the player is free to stand\n            wherever\n            they like. The server receives the point if the ball is struck without the serve bouncing.Once a service has\n            been\n            made, the number of shots that can be exchanged between the players is limitless. The point is scored when\n            the\n            bad\n            decision is to return the ball to the scoring areas.Points are given out in increments of 15, 30, and 40. 15\n            equals\n            one point, 30 equals two, and 40 equals three. To win a game, you’ll need four points. Deuce refers to a\n            game\n            that\n            ends with a score of 40-40. To win the game, a player must win two consecutive points from deuce. They have\n            an\n            edge\n            after gaining one point from deuce.If a player wins the following point, the game is over; if they lose, the\n            game is\n            reset to deuce.A player must win six games by a margin of two or more to win the set. If the first set ends\n            in a\n            tie, the second set will go to a tie break, with players playing first to 7 points.If a player touches the\n            net,\n            confuses his opponent, or obstructs his opponent in any manner, the point is instantly lost.If the ball hits\n            any\n            section of the line, the point is called in; if it hits outside the line, the ball is out.Every six games,\n            the\n            balls\n            in a tennis match are replaced with new balls.If a player fails to return the ball in the correct spots on\n            the\n            court, hits the net, and does not go into the opponent’s area, or returns the ball before it bounces twice\n            in\n            their\n            half, they lose a point.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <table class=\"ranking-table\">\n        <tr>\n            <th>Top 5 Male Players</th>\n            <th>Top 5 Female Players</th>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Novak Djokovic</li>\n                    <li>Carlos Alcaraz</li>\n                    <li>Daniil Medvedev</li>\n                    <li>Jannik Sinner</li>\n                    <li>Andrey Rublev</li>\n                </ol>\n            </td>\n\n            <td>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Iga Swiatek</li>\n                    <li>Aryna Sabalenka</li>\n                    <li>Coco Gauff</li>\n                    <li>Jessica Pegula</li>\n                    <li>Elena Rybakina</li>\n                </ol>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </table>\n    <a href=\"https://howtheyplay.com/individual-sports/12-Singles-Tennis-Strategy-Tips-To-Help-Your-Game\">Competing in\n        tennis singles</a>\n    <br>Playing tennis single can be good and bad.
