It was also included as an event in the Olympics in 1900, 1912, 1920, and 1924\n            but\n            was excluded from the Olympics held between 1925 and 2011.

It is also now included as an event at each of the four grand slam tournaments (Australian Open,\n            French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open).\n        </p>\n    </div>    \n    </div>\n    <table class=\"ranking-table\">\n        <tr>\n            <th>Top 5 Ranked Mixed Doubles Teams</th>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Margaret Smith-Court and Ken Fletcher</li>\n                    <li>Billie Jean King and Owen Davidson</li>\n                    <li>Margaret Smith-Court and Marty Riessen</li>\n                    <li>Martina Hingis and Leander Paes</li>\n                    <li>Betty Stove and Frew McMillian</li>\n                </ol>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </table>\n    <br>\n    <a href=\"https://mytennishq.com/tennis-mixed-doubles-rules-the-easy-guide/\">Tennis Mixed\n        Doubles Rules</a>\n    <br>\n    In general, tennis mixed doubles rules are the same as for regular doubles. Serving rules are the same, as each\n    player (both male or female) serves until a game is won or lost. Each player will serve to both players in the\n    opposing team, and vice versa. Scoring rules are generally the same, with a 10-point tiebreaker as the deciding set.\n\n    <br>\n    <hr>\n    <div>\n        Sources: <a\n            href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-tennis-mixed-doubles-18f837c4c6ee527cefefabf7c1251825\">https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-tennis-mixed-doubles-18f837c4c6ee527cefefabf7c1251825</a><br>\n        <a\n            href=\"https://toomanyrackets.com/mixed-doubles-in-tennis/\">https://toomanyrackets.com/mixed-doubles-in-tennis/</a><br>\n        <a\n            href=\"https://www.rookieroad.com/tennis/top-6-best-mixed-doubles-tennis-teams-all-time-9313252/#:~:text=Top%206%20Best%20Mixed%20Doubles%20Tennis%20Teams%20of,6.%20Margaret%20Osbourne%20DuPont%20and%20Neale%20Fraser%20\">https://www.rookieroad.com/tennis/top-6-best-mixed-doubles-tennis-teams-all-time-9313252/#:~:text=Top%206%20Best%20Mixed%20Doubles%20Tennis%20Teams%20of,6.%20Margaret%20Osbourne%20DuPont%20and%20Neale%20Fraser%20</a>\n        <br>\n        <a\n            href=\"https://mytennishq.com/tennis-mixed-doubles-rules-the-easy-guide/\">https://mytennishq.com/tennis-mixed-doubles-rules-the-easy-guide/</a>\n    </div>\n</body>\n\n</html>","count_time":{"symbolsCount":"2.4k","symbolsTime":"2 mins."},"toc":"<ol class=\"toc\"><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-1\"><a class=\"toc-link\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Tennis mixed doubles</span></a></li></ol>","data":[]}
